    "# Comprehensive Report: Evaluation of the Provided Jupyter Notebook as a Proof-of-Concept for Spine Posture Monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "This report evaluates the provided Jupyter notebook (`spline_interp (19).ipynb`) as a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a posture monitoring system using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to model the spine via cubic spline interpolation, detect deviations, and potentially provide haptic feedback. The system aims to address poor sustained posture by interpolating sensor data into a 3D spine model, calibrating a \"base\" posture, and alerting users via vibrations at deviation points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code represents a **solid but incomplete PoC**. It demonstrates core concepts like serial data acquisition, forward kinematics, spline interpolation, curvature calculation, and basic visualization. However, it has gaps in robustness, error handling, and completeness (e.g., truncated sections, unimplemented features like haptic serial output). Clarity is moderate but hindered by informal notes and minor errors. With refinements, it could impress orthopedic surgeons as an innovative student project, suggesting an advanced high school or early undergraduate level in computer science/engineering with biomedical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critiques focus on code structure, documentation, and technical accuracy. Suggestions include refactoring for modularity, adding a polished README, and evidence-based citations. The notes in the code are a good start but insufficient for true beta testing—additional steps like validation against real biomechanical data and user testing are needed. Engaging surgeons could provide valuable input on modeling approaches (e.g., biomechanics-informed splines), and while the system has potential to ease their workload (e.g., via remote monitoring), it requires clinical validation to confirm utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed feedback follows in sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Is This a Finished Proof-of-Concept?\n",
    "### Overview of the Project Goal\n",
    "The notebook outlines a system to:\n",
    "- Read acceleration data from multiple IMUs via serial (Arduino).\n",
    "- Normalize and position data using forward kinematics based on user-input linear distances between sensors.\n",
    "- Interpolate positions into a 3D cubic spline model of the spine.\n",
    "- Calculate curvature (κ) along the spline to detect posture deviations.\n",
    "- Include a calibration phase to establish a \"base\" posture.\n",
    "- Visualize in real-time (3D plot + curvature graph).\n",
    "- Plan for haptic feedback (vibrations at deviation \"hotspots\") and alerts for sustained poor posture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aligns with exploring posture monitoring to prevent issues like back pain, with potential applications in orthopedics (e.g., scoliosis tracking or post-surgery rehab).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment as a PoC\n",
    "- **Strengths as a PoC**: Yes, it captures the basis of what you want explored. The core pipeline (data ingestion → positioning → interpolation → curvature analysis → visualization) works conceptually. The use of `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` for parametric curves and curvature formula (based on vector derivatives) is appropriate for modeling a flexible spine. The calibration logic (e.g., interquartile mean for baseline curvature) shows thoughtful handling of noise/variability. The animation demonstrates real-time potential, and notes on future ML integration add forward-thinking depth.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Limitations as a \"Finished\" PoC**: No, it's not fully finished. Key gaps include:\n",
    "  - **Unimplemented Features**: Haptic feedback serial output (e.g., `serial.bwrite'{3},{STATIC},{HIGH}'`) is mentioned but not coded. Deviation detection is partial (e.g., threshold-based alerts aren't fully triggered).\n",
    "  - **Testing and Validation**: No real data validation (e.g., against known spine curvatures from medical imaging like X-rays). The code assumes ideal sensor placement and lacks drift compensation (e.g., via Kalman filtering, as noted).\n",
    "  - **Robustness**: Serial reading assumes perfect data flow; no handling for dropped packets or sensor failures. The forward kinematics uses basic vector addition, prone to rotation errors (gimbal lock, as you note—quaternions are a good pivot).\n",
    "  - **Truncation**: The document is truncated (e.g., \"...(truncated 499540 characters)...\"), so full execution isn't verifiable. The animation function has placeholders and potential infinite loops.\n",
    "  - **Scalability**: Fixed to 3 IMUs (hardcoded IDs 1,2,7); generalization to \"n-number\" IMUs is incomplete.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, it's a **promising prototype** that proves the concept on simulated/simple data but needs polishing for real-world demo or beta testing. It effectively explores spline-based spine modeling but isn't \"finished\" without full integration and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Evaluation of Code Clarity and Effectiveness\n",
    "### Clarity\n",
    "- **Positive Aspects**:\n",
    "  - Markdown cells provide good context (e.g., project description, notes for future improvements). Sections like \"Serial Reading & Setup\" and \"Functions & Algorithms\" are logically organized.\n",
    "  - Comments in code are helpful (e.g., explaining normalization: \"ONLY APPENDING ACCELERATION, TO CHANGE WHEN DOING KALMAN FILTERING\").\n",
    "  - Mathematical notation (e.g., LaTeX for curvature κ) adds professionalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issues**:\n",
    "  - **Informal/Stream-of-Consciousness Notes**: Phrases like \"Notes for future me:\" or \"A pretty big note for this is that the constant of 250...\" feel casual and unpolished. They mix personal todos with explanations, reducing readability for external reviewers.\n",
    "  - **Inconsistent Formatting**: Variable names mix styles (e.g., `IMU_DEQUES` vs. `linear_distances`). Some cells have redundant imports (e.g., `import numpy as np` multiple times).\n",
    "  - **Truncation and Placeholders**: The animate function is cut off, and curvature plotting uses a hardcoded \"250\" without clear justification (you note it as adjustable for accuracy, but no dynamic calculation).\n",
    "  - **Lack of Docstrings**: Functions like `forward_kinematics` lack formal docstrings explaining inputs/outputs/ assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness\n",
    "- **Positive Aspects**:\n",
    "  - **Core Logic**: Forward kinematics and spline interpolation are effectively implemented. Curvature calculation uses a vector-based formula, which is mathematically sound for parametric curves.\n",
    "  - **Efficiency**: Uses deques for buffering (good for real-time data) and NumPy/SciPy for vector ops (efficient for 250-point splines).\n",
    "  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib 3D animation is effective for demoing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Minor Errors and Accumulation Risks**:\n",
    "  - **Potential Accumulation Errors**:\n",
    "    - Normalization: `IMU_DATA_NORM = IMU_DATA/np.linalg.norm(IMU_DATA)` assumes non-zero norm; zero-vector edge cases could cause division-by-zero (add epsilon or check).\n",
    "    - Forward Kinematics: Cumulative positioning (`new_pos = positions[i-1] + link_vector`) assumes sequential sensor order; misordered inputs could accumulate drift. Rotation issues (as noted) could compound over time, leading to inaccurate curves.\n",
    "    - Curvature Loop: Iterating over 250 points per frame could accumulate floating-point errors or slow performance on low-end hardware (optimize with vectorized NumPy ops).\n",
    "    - Time-Based Logic: `time.time()` for calibration/poor posture thresholds is fine but susceptible to system clock drift; use monotonic timers (`time.monotonic()`) for precision.\n",
    "  - **Minor Bugs**:\n",
    "    - In serial setup: `ID_NUM = int(line.strip(\":\")[-3])` assumes exact format; malformed Arduino output could crash.\n",
    "    - Segmentation Algorithm: Uses `np.cumsum(array) / np.sum(array)`—good, but if `linear_distances` sum to zero (invalid input), division error.\n",
    "    - Interquartile Mean: Sorts and slices correctly, but for small lists (<4 elements), it might under-sample; add checks for n> threshold.\n",
    "    - Plot Limits: `plot_radius = sum(linear_distances) * 1.125` is arbitrary; dynamic auto-scaling would be better.\n",
    "  - **Notation Issues**: Informal math notes (e.g., \"n_i ≡ 1\" in segmentation) are unclear without full context. Curvature derivation section is incomplete (links to Khan Academy but no full workings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the code is effective for a solo prototype but lacks defensive programming, which could lead to crashes in real use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Critiques and Suggestions for Improvement\n",
    "### Critiques\n",
    "- **Technical**: Reliance on Euler angles/ vectors for kinematics invites gimbal lock; quaternions (as noted) are essential. Curvature max as deviation metric is simplistic—spine biomechanics involve lordosis/kyphosis thresholds, not just peak κ.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Monolithic cells (e.g., long animate function) make debugging hard. No modularity (e.g., separate files for utils).\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Lacks citations for health claims (e.g., \"why poor, sustained posture is bad\")—crucial for surgeons.\n",
    "- **User Experience**: Input prompts are basic; no GUI for distances/calibration.\n",
    "- **Ethical/Practical**: Assumes adult users; no privacy considerations for data storage. Haptic feedback intensity isn't scaled to deviation severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for Presentation (to Avoid Rejection by Surgeons)\n",
    "- **Refactor Code**: Break into classes (e.g., `SpineModel` class with methods for calibration, interpolation). Use PEP8 style (e.g., consistent spacing).\n",
    "- **Add a Polished README.md**: Include:\n",
    "  - Project overview (refine your description).\n",
    "  - Setup instructions (dependencies, hardware).\n",
    "  - Demo video/GIF of running code.\n",
    "  - Limitations and future work (e.g., quaternion upgrade).\n",
    "  - Evidence-based section: Cite studies (e.g., from PubMed on posture risks, IMU accuracy in biomechanics).\n",
    "- **Version Control**: Host on GitHub; use branches for beta versions.\n",
    "- **Beta Packaging**: Bundle as a standalone script/app (e.g., via PyInstaller). Add logging for errors.\n",
    "- **Impression Tips**: Frame as \"student-led innovation seeking expert feedback.\" Emphasize interdisciplinary angle (CS + biomechanics). Prepare a 1-page PDF summary with visuals, not just the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Educational Level Assessment\n",
    "- **Inferred Level**: This code suggests an **advanced high school student or early undergraduate** (e.g., freshman/sophomore). It's beyond basic Python (uses SciPy, Matplotlib 3D, serial I/O) but not professional-grade (e.g., no unit tests, basic error handling).\n",
    "- **What They're Studying**: Likely **Computer Science/Engineering with Biomedical or Robotics Focus**. Elements like forward kinematics and splines point to robotics/mechatronics; posture application suggests bioengineering interest. Math (curvature derivation) implies strong calculus/physics background (e.g., A-level/IB equivalent).\n",
    "- **Impression on Surgeons**: Positive if presented as evidence-based (add citations). It shows initiative, technical skill, and real-world application—surgeons might see you as a promising pre-med/engineering student. To enhance: Include biomechanics references (e.g., from \"Biomechanics of the Spine\" texts) to demonstrate rigor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Sufficiency of Your Improvement Notes\n",
    "Your notes (e.g., quaternion switch, biomechanics integration, README, usability focus) are **strong but insufficient for real beta testing**. Completing them addresses key gaps (e.g., rotation accuracy, documentation), but add:\n",
    "- **Validation**: Test with phantom spine models or volunteers; compare to gold-standard (e.g., motion capture).\n",
    "- **Safety/Compliance**: Ensure haptic feedback avoids injury; consider IRB/ethics for human testing.\n",
    "- **ML/Data Storage**: Implement basic CSV export; simple ML (e.g., clustering postures) for \"good\" vs. \"bad.\"\n",
    "- **Timeline**: Aim for December usability focus, but prioritize validation now for beta credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these additions, you'd reach a solid beta stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Engaging Surgeons: Further Information, Alternatives, and Impact\n",
    "### Suggested Questions for Surgeons\n",
    "- \"What spine metrics (e.g., Cobb angle vs. curvature) are most clinically relevant for posture monitoring?\"\n",
    "- \"How could IMU data integrate with existing tools like X-rays or wearables?\"\n",
    "- \"What patient scenarios (e.g., scoliosis, post-op) would benefit most?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approaches\n",
    "- **Modeling**: Use B-splines or NURBS for biomechanically constrained curves (e.g., incorporating vertebral limits). Explore ML-based models (e.g., neural ODEs for dynamic spines) or finite element analysis for realism.\n",
    "- **Sensors**: Fuse with gyro/magnetometer for full IMU (via Madgwick filter) to reduce drift.\n",
    "- **Detection**: Shift to dynamic posture (e.g., via HMM for movement patterns) per your notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Would This Make Their Lives Easier?\n",
    "- **Potential Yes**: Remote monitoring could reduce clinic visits, enable early intervention (e.g., alerting to worsening curvature), and provide data for personalized rehab. In orthopedics, tools like this could track compliance in braces/scoliosis management, saving time on manual assessments.\n",
    "- **Caveats**: Needs clinical trials for accuracy (e.g., vs. Moire topography). Surgeons prioritize evidence—without validation, it's a novelty. If proven, it could ease lives by quantifying \"sustained poor posture,\" which is subjective today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
    "This PoC effectively explores IMU-based spine modeling but requires completion for beta readiness. Focus on robustness, documentation, and validation to impress surgeons. Prioritize your notes, add evidence-based elements, and reach out via LinkedIn with a tailored pitch (e.g., \"Seeking feedback on student project for posture tech\"). This could lead to collaborations—great for your portfolio!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you provide the full untruncated notebook or specific sections, I can refine this feedback further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Short-Term Improvements Before Sunday (September 28, 2025)\n",
    "Since you have only a few days (from September 25), focus on quick, high-impact changes that polish your presentation without requiring major rewrites or hardware testing. The goal is to make the code and proposal feel more \"shareable\" for initial feedback from a biomedical engineer—emphasizing clarity, professionalism, and evidence of progress. Prioritize the Jupyter notebook (from the nbviewer link) and PDF proposal, as they're your core artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Polish the Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "   - **Add Structure and Documentation**: Convert informal notes (e.g., \"Notes for future me\") into a clean Markdown section at the top titled \"Project Overview and Roadmap.\" Expand the project description with 2-3 sentences on health impacts (cite sources from your PDF, like An et al., 2023). Add brief explanations for each code section (e.g., \"This cell handles serial setup for IMU data ingestion. Potential issues: Assumes clean Arduino output; add try-except for robustness.\").\n",
    "   - **Fix Minor Errors and Add Comments**:\n",
    "     - In serial reading: Add error handling (e.g., `try: ID_NUM = int(line.strip(\":\")[-3]) except ValueError: print(\"Malformed data\")`).\n",
    "     - In forward kinematics: Comment on assumptions (e.g., \"# Assumes fixed link lengths; future: integrate quaternions to fix rotation drift\").\n",
    "     - Curvature calculation: Replace hardcoded \"250\" with a variable (e.g., `NUM_POINTS = 250`) and explain: \"# Adjustable for accuracy; higher values increase resolution but computation time.\"\n",
    "     - Add docstrings to functions (e.g., for `forward_kinematics`: `\"\"\"Computes positions using IMU data and distances. Returns: list of 3D positions.\"\"\"`).\n",
    "   - **Create a Demo Output**: Run the notebook to generate sample plots (even with simulated data). Save as HTML via nbconvert (`jupyter nbconvert --to html spline_interp.ipynb`) for easy sharing. If possible, record a 1-minute video demo (using phone) showing the animation running.\n",
    "   - **Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours. Upload the updated version to your GitHub repo (from the tree link, it looks like you have the notebook there—add a README.md with a quick summary and run instructions).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Refine the PDF Proposal**\n",
    "   - **Integrate Literature Review**: Your attached PDF already has a strong lit review (e.g., Michaud et al., 2022 on IMU accuracy; Shaheen et al., 2023 on UCS detection). Expand Section 1.1 by 1-2 paragraphs: Discuss how your spline interpolation builds on Michaud's 3D modeling (e.g., \"Our cubic spline approach extends this by enabling real-time curvature analysis for haptic triggers\"). Add a figure from your notebook (e.g., a sample curvature plot) to visualize.\n",
    "   - **Clarify Pseudocode**: In pages 4-5, format the pseudocode more professionally (use a monospace font or LaTeX listings package if editing in Overleaf). Add comments explaining ties to biomechanics (e.g., \"# Curvature threshold based on clinical norms like Cobb angle deviations\").\n",
    "   - **Add a \"Current Progress\" Section**: Insert before Section 2: Summarize notebook achievements (e.g., \"Implemented serial IMU reading, forward kinematics, and cubic spline with curvature plotting. Next: Kalman integration for noise reduction\").\n",
    "   - **Professional Touches**: Fix minor typos (e.g., \"hospot\" → \"hotspot\" in notebook notes; consistent formatting in pseudocode). End with a call-to-action: \"Seeking feedback on accuracy/validation—contact me at [your email].\"\n",
    "   - **Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours. Re-export as PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Prepare for Sharing**\n",
    "   - **Bundle Materials**: Create a ZIP with the updated notebook, PDF, and a 1-page cover letter: \"Dear [Name], As a sixth-form student developing an IMU-based posture brace for my A-Level DT project, I'd value your feedback on the attached prototype code and proposal. Key questions: Is the spline/curvature approach biomechanically sound? Suggestions for accuracy improvements?\"\n",
    "   - **Test Run**: Share with a teacher/peer first for quick feedback.\n",
    "   - **Why This is Sufficient**: Your current code shows functional PoC (serial + interpolation + viz). With these tweaks, it looks more intentional and ready for \"beta\" input without seeming unfinished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim to complete by Saturday evening for final review.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Avenues for Writing and Presentation\n",
    "To get detailed feedback on what people \"actually want,\" iterate on your proposal by testing formats that encourage responses. Your PDF is academic and strong (e.g., ethical considerations on page 6 show maturity), but for engineers/surgeons, make it more actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pitch Deck Alternative**: Create a 10-slide Google Slides/PowerPoint (1 hour): Slide 1: Problem (poor posture stats from lit review). Slide 2-3: Solution (IMU + haptics diagram). Slide 4: Tech Stack (notebook excerpts). Slide 5: Lit Review Highlights (e.g., 99.3% accuracy from Shaheen et al., page 3 of PDF). Slide 6: Roadmap (your notes + Phase 1 goals from page 5). Slide 7: Validation Needs (e.g., \"Compare to Cobb angle?\"). Slide 8: Your Background (sixth-form DT for Imperial application). Slide 9: Call for Feedback. Slide 10: References. Share via link for easier engagement.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Blog Post or Medium Article**: Write a 800-word post: \"Building a Smart Posture Brace: From IMU Data to Haptic Feedback.\" Embed notebook screenshots, PDF excerpts, and questions like \"What deviation thresholds do clinicians use?\" Post on LinkedIn/Reddit (r/biomedicalengineering) for organic feedback. Link your GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Video Pitch**: 2-3 minute YouTube/LinkedIn video: Demo the notebook animation, explain lit review ties (e.g., \"Inspired by Michaud's 12mm error IMU modeling\"), and end with \"Feedback welcome on accuracy—DM me.\" This humanizes the project for applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Testing Plan**: To \"test out here to a large degree,\" add a section to your PDF (page 7): Propose simple A/B testing (e.g., \"Recruit 10 peers for 1-week wear trials; measure self-reported posture improvement via surveys\"). This shows you're thinking about validation, key for Imperial's design engineering focus on user-centered design.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more feedback: Post on forums like Reddit's r/EngineeringStudents or BioMedicalEngineering—ask \"What features would you want in a posture monitor?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus on Accuracy: Kalman Filtering and Fitting with A-Levels\n",

    "## Detailed Code Improvements: Focusing on Solving New Problems\n",
    "You're right—my previous suggestions leaned heavily on cleanup and polish, which is essential for presentation but doesn't advance the core functionality. Below, I'll focus on **substantive improvements that solve new or existing problems** in your code (based on the Jupyter notebook from your nbviewer link). These address key issues like noise accumulation, incomplete features (e.g., haptic output, deviation alerts), scalability to n IMUs, and biomechanical accuracy. I'll explain the problem each solves, why it's important for your project's credibility (especially in discussions with biomedical engineers), and provide **specific code snippets** you can implement by tomorrow or over the weekend. These build on your notes (e.g., quaternions, biomechanics) and tie into your PDF proposal's emphasis on real-time feedback and clinical utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim to integrate 1-2 of these today for your demo output—e.g., haptic serial output and n-IMU generalization, as they directly complete the \"send off the position, type and intensity of deviance\" todo. Test with simulated data if hardware isn't ready. This will demonstrate progress beyond visualization, showing a functional closed-loop system (data in → model → feedback out), which impresses in mature conversations (e.g., \"How does the system handle sensor drift in real-time?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Implement Haptic Feedback Serial Output (Solves: Incomplete Feedback Loop)**\n",
    "   - **Problem Solved**: Your code reads IMU data, models the spine, and calculates curvature, but doesn't output alerts/haptics (as noted in your todos: \"Send off the position, type and intensity of deviance\"). This leaves the system passive—great for monitoring, but not for \"alerting them of this poor, sustained posture\" as described in your PDF. Adding this creates a true PoC for habit formation via biofeedback, aligning with lit review refs like van der Weegen et al. (2021) on active feedback efficacy.\n",
    "   - **Why Important**: Biomedical engineers will ask about closed-loop control (e.g., latency, intensity scaling). This shows engineering maturity and ties to clinical apps (e.g., remote monitoring in your proposal).\n",
    "   - **Implementation Steps**:\n",
    "     - In the animation loop (after curvature calculation), detect max κ deviation from calibration threshold.\n",
    "     - Map deviation to position (using segmented t values), type (e.g., \"STATIC\" for sustained >5s), intensity (\"LOW/MED/HIGH\" based on κ magnitude).\n",
    "     - Send via serial (e.g., '{3},{STATIC},{HIGH}' to Arduino for motor at segment 3).\n",
    "     - Add timing to check \"sustained\" (use `time.time()` deque for 5s window).\n",
    "   - **Code Snippet** (Add after curvature_list in the animate function):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Problem: No output for haptics. Solution: Detect deviation and send serial command\n",
    "     import time  # Already imported, but ensure\n",
    "     from collections import deque  # Already used\n",
    "\n",

    "     - **Demo Impact**: In your video, show console output or LED blink simulating haptics—discuss latency (<50ms ideal) in conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Add Quaternion-Based Rotation Handling (Solves: Rotation Drift in Forward Kinematics)**\n",
    "   - **Problem Solved**: Your forward kinematics uses vector addition, but as noted (\"fixing the rotation issue\"), it accumulates errors from Euler angles (gimbal lock, drift). This makes curves \"not look like curves\" and reduces biomechanical accuracy (e.g., vs. Michaud et al.'s 12mm error). Quaternions provide stable 3D rotations, essential for multi-IMU chains.\n",
    "   - **Why Important**: Surgeons/engineers will probe accuracy (e.g., \"How do you handle IMU orientation drift?\"). This aligns with your PDF's UCS/AIS focus, where precise spinal alignment matters.\n",
    "   - **Implementation Steps**:\n",
    "     - Use `scipy.spatial.transform` (already import scipy) to convert IMU accel to quaternions.\n",
    "     - Replace vector-based positioning with quaternion multiplication for rotations.\n",
    "     - Calibrate initial orientations during setup.\n",

    "\n",
    "         return positions\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - **Time Estimate**: 1-2 hours. Test: Compare old/new plots—curves should be smoother.\n",
    "     - **Discussion Prep**: Explain: \"Quaternions reduce gimbal lock; next, fuse with gyro via Madgwick filter for full AHRS.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Generalize to n IMUs and Segment Hotspots (Solves: Fixed 3-IMU Limit, Unplotted Hotspots)**\n",
    "   - **Problem Solved**: Hardcoded to IDs [1,2,7]; can't scale to \"n-number of IMUs\" as intended. Also, no hotspot plotting/deviance segmentation (todos: \"Get the hotspot points plotting\", \"Segment the spine\").\n",
    "   - **Why Important**: Flexibility shows design thinking (e.g., for cervical/thoracic focus in your PDF). Engineers might suggest varying n for different patients.\n",
    "   - **Implementation Steps**:\n",
    "     - Dynamically map IMU IDs from serial.\n",
    "     - Segment t based on cumsum(linear_distances).\n",

    "     ax.legend()\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - **Time Estimate**: 45 mins. Test: Simulate extra IMUs with random data.\n",
    "     - **Discussion Prep**: \"Supports 2-10 IMUs; segments via cumsum for vertebral mapping.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Integrate Basic Kalman Filtering (Solves: Noise Accumulation)**\n",
    "   - **Problem Solved**: Raw accel data is noisy; normalization helps but doesn't filter drift (your note: \"Reducing the accumulation of noise\"). Kalman fuses accel/gyro (add gyro reading) for stable positions.\n",
    "   - **Why Important**: Accuracy is biomed priority (e.g., Shaheen et al.'s 99.3% in your PDF). Discuss: \"EKF reduces RMSE by 20-30% in IMU fusion.\"\n",
    "   - **Implementation Steps**: Add gyro parsing; apply simple Kalman to positions.\n",
    "   - **Code Snippet** (Add function; call before forward_kinematics):\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     def kalman_filter(accel, gyro, prev_state, dt=0.01, process_noise=0.1, measurement_noise=1.0):\n",
    "         \"\"\"\n",
    "         Simple 1D Kalman per axis for position filtering (extend to EKF for full).\n",

    "\n",
    "         # Update\n",
    "         kalman_gain = predicted_cov / (predicted_cov + measurement_noise)\n",
    "         filtered = predicted + kalman_gain * (accel - predicted)\n",

    "     filtered_data = [kalman_filter(accel[i], gyro[i], prev_state[i]) for i in range(3)]  # Assume gyro added to serial\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     - **Time Estimate**: 1 hour (start simple; expand later).\n",
    "     - **Discussion Prep**: \"Basic KF; planning Madgwick for quaternion fusion.\"\n",
