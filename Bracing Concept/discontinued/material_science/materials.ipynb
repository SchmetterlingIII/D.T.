    "### Materials To Consider\n",
    "- **Foam**: provides the comfort support for the project\n",
    "- **Plastic & Magnetic Sheet**: needs to be strong enough to hold the sensors whilst also flexible enough to accurately read off the spine's curvature with high precision\n",
    "- **Fabrics**: should be breathable and lightweight for the user to feel comfortable. Should help in the distribution of the weight of the components (*how?*)\n",
