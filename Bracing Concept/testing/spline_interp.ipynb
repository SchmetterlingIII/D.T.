        "    * **Mathematical Challenge:** True curvature ($ \\kappa $) is defined by the formula $ \\kappa(t)=\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{S}'(t) \\times \\mathbf{S}''(t)\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{S}'(t)\\|^3} $. A powerful and effective proxy for this is the **magnitude of the second derivative vector**:\n",

        "    * **Challenge:** Modify your Arduino code. It needs to continuously `Serial.read()` to check for incoming data *while* also performing its regular sensor measurements. An `if (Serial.available() > 0)` block will be essential here. When the character `'L'` is received, trigger the onboard LED to flash. This creates the fundamental feedback loop for your haptic motor system later on."
