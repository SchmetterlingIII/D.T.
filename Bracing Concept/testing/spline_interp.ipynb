        "\n",
        "-   **Serial to Vector:** Implement a Python script to read and parse the serial stream from the Arduino, converting the raw text into a list of 3D vectors `[(ax1, ay1, az1), (ax2, ay2, az2), ...]`.\n",
        "-   **Kinematic Chain Algorithm:** Adapt your `forward_kinematics` function to calculate the 3D position of each sensor relative to the one before it, forming a kinematic chain.\n",
        "-   **Live Visualisation:** Use `matplotlib`'s animation capabilities to create a 3D scatter plot in Thonny that updates in real-time with the calculated sensor positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenge 2: Real-time Parametric Spline Interpolation\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective:** To fit a smooth, 3D curve through the live sensor positions, creating a dynamic model of the spine's shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Parametric `CubicSpline`:**\n",
        "    * **Task:** Use `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline` instead of `interp1d`. Create three separate spline objects: `cs_x`, `cs_y`, and `cs_z`.\n",
        "    * **Exploration:** The `t` parameter will be the measured linear distance between your sensors along the spine model (your `linear_distance` list). You will interpolate each axis against this parameter: `cs_x = CubicSpline(t_values, x_positions)`, `cs_y = CubicSpline(t_values, y_positions)`, etc. This is the core of your parametrisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Data Handling & Error Management:**\n",
        "    * **Task:** Your real-time loop (Read -> Calculate -> Interpolate) must be robust. What happens if the Arduino sends a corrupted line of data or a sensor reading spikes unnaturally?\n",
        "    * **Challenge:** Investigate using `collections.deque` with a fixed length (e.g., `maxlen=5`) to create a moving average for your sensor data. This can smooth out noise and make your spline less erratic. For handling errors (like a missed serial line), implement a `try-except` block to catch parsing errors and decide whether to skip the frame or reuse the last valid data.\n",

        "### Challenge 3 & 4: Real-time Curvature Analysis & Feedback\n",

        "    * **Mathematical Challenge:** True curvature ($ \\kappa $) is defined by the formula $ \\kappa(t)=\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{S}'(t) \\times \\mathbf{S}''(t)\\|}{\\|\\mathbf{S}'(t)\\|^3} $. A powerful and effective proxy for this is the **magnitude of the second derivative vector**:\n",

        "        Your task is to calculate this value at various points along each segment of your spline in real-time.\n",
        "    * **Resource:** Your link on deriving curvature (`mathematics.stackexchange.com`) is excellent for understanding the theory. Focus on implementing the proxy formula first, as it directly relates curvature to the second derivatives you can easily compute.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Segment-Specific Thresholding:**\n",
        "    * **Task:** Create a list or dictionary of threshold values, one for each segment of the spine (e.g., `thresholds = [3.5, 4.0, 4.2, 3.8, 3.5]`).\n",
        "    * **Challenge:** In your animation loop, check if the calculated curvature proxy for a specific segment exceeds its corresponding threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Arduino Feedback Loop:**\n",
        "    * **Task:** When a threshold is breached, use Python's `serial` library to send a specific character (e.g., `'L'`) back to the Arduino.\n",
        "    * **Challenge:** Modify your Arduino code. It needs to continuously `Serial.read()` to check for incoming data *while* also performing its regular sensor measurements. An `if (Serial.available() > 0)` block will be essential here. When the character `'L'` is received, trigger the onboard LED to flash. This creates the fundamental feedback loop for your haptic motor system later on."
