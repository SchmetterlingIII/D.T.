    "# 2D Spline Interpretation\n",
    "Basic task: interpretating the curvature of a 2D function to see how this can be visualised. As a basic introduction, only the second derviative was used to understand visually what is means and its significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, however, I developed my understanding of the function and moved to a measure that was dependent on the relative curvature of the function and researched into mathematical curvature. "
