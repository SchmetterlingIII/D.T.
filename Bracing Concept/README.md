## testing
These files contain the technical aspects of the code for this project (such as the cubic spline interpolation or the data reading from the IMU sensors). Commits and the structure of the files in this current state is exploratory as these concepts are quite new or advanced but this should convey my progression of understanding for this project

## images & documents
Within this includes the first .pdf of a proposal for researchers to work with me on this project. I will send another one after all technical aspects are finished to ask for advice on the parametrisation of the spine into a smooth curve and how to extract more detail from the sensors in a way that aligns with current data and medical practices

## discontinued
Discontinued avenues that still show the sense of progression but are currently irrelevant to my work.
