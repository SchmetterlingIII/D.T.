    "{{Introduction}}: I am an outpatient currently with relatively mild scoliosis and, given my current interests in bio- and design engineering, have been researching and designing a device that can correct posture.  \n",
    "Designing a posture correction device that makes users aware when they are slouching by vibrating. This is done through an array of inertial measurement units (IMUs) that record the local acceleration and angular velocities (through accelermoeters and gyrocsopies) in order to produce a piecewise function of the data points - with the intention of having this develop into a multi-body spine model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having completed a basic sensor interpretation and forward kinematics test, I am moving onto a cubic spline interpolation - where I will use this function approximator to produce the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I wouldn't understand how I can get this to accurately model out the shape of the spine given a semi-random distribution of sensors. Further, I don't understand how this can be abstracted to apply for spinal curvatures (my initial temptation), even if I am to surpass this initial hurdle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I am open to a conversation on this approach: are you free for a call, for work experience or to be passed onto areas where research is actually taking place to understand this more detailedly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kind regards, \n",
