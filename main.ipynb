    "- Read in the data from the serial and unpack it so that it can be interpreted\n",
    "- Clean up this data further such that the accelerometer data is cleaned (`madgwick-filter(accelerometer_data)`) and the output of this are the direction vectors of the tilt. *Further improvements to this function could also input the gyroscope and magnetometer data and have a more comprehensive input--the output will still be the direction vector of the tilt for each IMU so it doesn't change much*.\n",
    "- Interpolate this appropriately (`forward-kinematics` then `cubic-spline-interp` is the current approach)\n",
    "- Curvature analysis class that -- using whatever interpolated functions -- creates a list of the curvatures at each input\n",
    "    - at first, the calibration phase happens where a distribution of the inputted curvatures (wrt their indices and time) are plotted for that duration (i.e. the state `calibration_duration`). This distribution is stored and then checked against for each instance outside of this test phase. I intend to use one-class support vector machine (SVM) but not sure currently. With enough tests (and ML that happens offline) I would like to produce a very inexpensive and accurate method of interpreting the data in the calibration phase but I am not sure currently and need guidance on how to interpret this data (in semi-real time).\n",
    "    - After this, if an inputted curvature (i.e. instance of the digital twin of the user's spine) has deviated beyond a defined boundary (**how should this be defined?**) then the segment of the spine that this data falls within (which has a corresponding haptic motor) will be alerted through the serial and vibrate on the area of deviation. On the updated plot, there will be a red dots along the arclength of deviation for an update.\n",
    "        - (for future proofing, I would also like for if there are high instances of static posture, but this feels like just another function and having the if condition be `if deviated or prolonged-static` where both of those are states within the class)\n",
    "    - Otherwise, there is just a plot of the digital twin on the screen (what other metrics would be cool to have later?)\n",
    "- plot the interpolated spline at a lower frequency than data is being interpreted and stored in database\n",
    "- all of this data needs to be stored in a database for ML later and a clearer interpretation of what is happening at specific timesteps and to isolate errors that can be debugged"
