# The Essence of My D.T. Coursework
I would like to design a product that can make people more aware of their posture, with the hope of this being commercialised in the future. 

Areas of consideration:
- Technicalities (code & maths)
- Ergonomics & Design (aesthetics & useability)
- Data & Iterations (for the refinement of models (whether designed or programmed))

## Current Evaluation
25/06/25: There has been a bias toward the technicalities of this project and a neglect for the design of it. The pace of work is relatively slow and inefficient as what I want to make for each section seems to be impulsive and not sustained research. 
I have two days for the next submission. 

Goals (before Friday):
- Complete all empty aspects of inDesign
- Finish iterating base housing model
- Design (and send to print out, although to be seen & handled only on Monday) the other aspects of the base to have that all completed.
- Pseudocode how to approach ergonomic focus over the summer (since I have not done much explicit designing -- and a portfolio needs to be developed of this final model...)
- Review and pseudocode the technical aspects of the whole project and plan on completing them
