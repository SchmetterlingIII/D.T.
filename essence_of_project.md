## D.T. Progression 
1. Cubic Spline (to finish first area by Sunday)
    *Currently working on a OneNote for this to work well.*
    - Understand how to produce dynamic cubic splines 
    - Understand how to have splines in 3D as well

2. Aesthetics (all of next week)
    - Current sketches although promising are not developed to any depth
    - There has been no CAD work over the holidays & the shrinking of the component distribution to be thin across the body has been neglected
    - The sketches produced can very quickly and easily be iterated to something I am more proud of

3. Human Centered Modelling (seeing how to make this accurate; reaching out to professionals)
    - Complete the technical background for the cubic spline then reach out for help on the positioning of the sensors on the back and how to read that someone is slouching (that is mathematical but I need the medical intuition even if I do know the maths)
    - Send this off to researchers in the UK to see whether I can work on this in a lab for a week and have some industry guidance; talk to some people on LinkedIn to check out the project and see what's up
        - Area: robotics, bioengineering, information engineering, design engineering
