## D.T. Essence
Designing a posture correction device aimed at heightening the awareness of users through haptic feedback and continual monitoring. My aim is to encourage user awareness of their posture and thus user autonomy on how they should approach treatments/exercises - hoping to alleviate the stress on healthcare systems by providing a preventative solution to spinal monitoring. 

## Deadlines
**Cubic spline evaluation wrt real curvature of spine: 26/07/25**
*To be sent to a list of orthopaedic surgeons (and researchers in London universities) opening myself up for help in making this adhere to spinal curves more specifically, demonstrating specific passion and relevant aptitude. Around 40 researchers will the bulk (kind of generic email) be sent to, where I will do a little research (but kind of inferred wrt the interests that I put in each) to see who will respond and who I can collaborate with.*

    Completed: 
        - A relatively complex algorithm that converts the IMU data of the sensors into parametrised models
        - Screenrecorded and recording the actual curves on the model
            - Trying to see what the deviances in the curves are and how to minimise this

**
## D.T. Progression 
*These are the rest of the points that need completion before the end of the holidays. After this is all done, I will be focusing on testing and minor iterations in D.T. lessons - but most of the time being spent on applications and making sure my other subjects are perfect.*

**Sections:**
- Cubic spline monitoring: *Converting the inputted sensor data into something that replicates the spine.*
- Aesthetics: *Trying to consider what it is users actually want, and abstracting the complexity such that users can focus on the data and not how it works.*
- Research & Outreach: *Reaching out to users and researchers to the improvements of the initial models that I have, with corresponding deadlines to each of these goals so that there is constant momentum in my work.*

1. Cubic Spline
*There is a OneNote page with works on this (screenshotted below):*

    - Understand how to produce dynamic cubic splines 
    - Understand how to have splines in 3D
    - How to adjust the parameters of the spline to fit the shape of the spine (**I will develop the basis of this, then reach out to see if people are working on - or know about - what shape the spine specifically holds, and which anchor points would help to provide a better approximation. I only have three sensors for this, so there will be a lot of error but it will be good to start with**)
    - Feedback on the deviancy of "good posture" (**Focusing on the feedback aspect, asking researchers for the help on the definition of a "good posture" in the firtst place.**)

2. Aesthetics 
    - CAD work needs development; curved brace aspect to model out the components, and see how they still fit wrt variations in the curvature of the model. 

    *Shown to be possible with Amelia Bryant's model screenshotted below:*

3. Human Centered Modelling (seeing how to make this accurate; reaching out to professionals)
    - Complete the technical background for the cubic spline then reach out for help on the positioning of the sensors on the back and how to read that someone is slouching (that is mathematical but I need the medical intuition even if I do know the maths)
    - Send this off to researchers in the UK to see whether I can work on this in a lab for a week and have some industry guidance; talk to some people on LinkedIn to check out the project and see what's up
        - Area: robotics, bioengineering, information engineering, design engineering
